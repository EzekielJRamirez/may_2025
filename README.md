read on selectors

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp
- find the order of importance
- then figure out the "every other odd/even" selectors

what is the diff between padding and margins???

- what else makes space???

Getting a weird error with the every nth element selector on div.css

- want to try for only odds/evens but the first div act semi indepent from the 3 divs right after it

TODO
